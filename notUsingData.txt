  "description": "When P.V. Narasimha Rao became the unlikely prime minister of India in 1991, he inherited economic crisis, violent insurgencies and a nation adrift. Despite being unloved by his people, mistrusted by his party, a minority in Parliament and ruling under the shadow of 10 Janpath, Rao reinvented India, at home and abroad. With exclusive access to Rao's never-before-seen personal papers as well as over a hundred interviews, this definitive biography provides new revelations on the Indian economy, nuclear programme, foreign policy and the Babri Masjid. Meticulously researched and honestly told, this landmark political biography is a must-read for anyone interested in the man responsible for transforming India.",
